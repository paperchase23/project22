        1. You must be the primary account holder of an eligible Wells Fargo consumer account with a FICO® Score available, and enrolled in Wells Fargo Online®. Eligible Wells Fargo consumer accounts include deposit, loan, and credit accounts, but other consumer accounts may also be eligible. Contact Wells Fargo for details. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.
        </p>
    <p>Please note that the score provided under this service is for educational purposes and may not be the score used by Wells Fargo to make credit decisions. Wells Fargo looks at many factors to determine your credit options; therefore, a specific FICO® Score or Wells Fargo credit rating does not guarantee a specific loan rate, approval of a loan, or an upgrade on a credit card.</p>

    <p>Wells Fargo and Fair Isaac are not credit repair organizations as defined under federal and state law, including the Credit Repair Organizations Act. Wells Fargo and Fair Isaac do not provide credit repair services or advice or assistance with rebuilding or improving your credit record, credit history, or credit rating.</p>
